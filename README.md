# MyMessages - Share it with the World

Welcome to the Source Code of the MyMessage app.</br>
The one app for sharing messages and reviews!

## About the Project

### Summary

This project is an hybrid between a _Twitter Clone_ and a _Yelp Clone_. Yet, the foundation for this app is the [MEAN Stack Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-2-and-nodejs-the-practical-guide/) from [academind.com/](https://academind.com).</br>
In this app, you can share messages and pictures with the world (like Twitter) or discover and review places acros the world (like Yelp).

### Core technologies

This application is built with the MEAN-stack, so these are the fundamental technologies:

- MongoDB - Document database
- Express - NodeJS web framework
- Angular - Client-side JavaScript framework
- NodeJS - JavaScript web server

With the help of Docker (and Docker-Compose), each part of the application will run in its own container.

- Backend - NodeJS/Express application
- Frontend - Angular SPA
- Database - MongoDB
