# MyMessages - Share it with the World

Welcome to the Source Code of the __MyMessage App__.</br>
The one app for sharing messages with the world!

## About the Project

### Summary

This project is a (very small) _Twitter Clone_. With this application, you can share messages and pictures with the world.</br>
Yet, the foundation for this app is the [MEAN Stack Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-2-and-nodejs-the-practical-guide/) from [Academind](https://academind.com).

### Core technologies

This application is built with the MEAN-stack, so these are the fundamental technologies:

- MongoDB - Document database
- Express - NodeJS web framework
- Angular - Client-side JavaScript framework
- NodeJS - JavaScript web server

With the help of Docker (and Docker-Compose), each part of the application will run in its own container.

- Backend - NodeJS/Express application
- Frontend - Angular SPA
- Database - MongoDB
